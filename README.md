# CanteenMenuAllesLeckerEssen

With the script `getmenudata.py`, the canteen menus for the current and the following month are read out from PDF files from a [caterer in Halle, Germany](https://www.alles-lecker-essen.de) and converted into a JSON file.

This is a special use case and will hardly be of interest to anyone. If so, I am grateful for suggestions for improvement or a pull request.
